This project was initially based on the work of [David
Wittman](https://github.com/DavidWittman) on his [DavidWittman.redis
role](https://github.com/DavidWittman/ansible-redis), but has since been
largely refactored and not so much of the original code remains. Therefore, I
took the liberty of changing the main copyright holder in the LICENSE.md file
(but still keeping the MIT license). If the original author decides that such
is not acceptable, please contact us to reach an agreement.
